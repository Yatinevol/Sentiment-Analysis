# **Sentiment Analysis**

This is a notebook containing **Sentiment Analysis** Mini Project on *Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews*. I am interested in Natural Language Processing and that is my motivation to make this project. I think that sentiment analysis has a really powerful impacts in business developments because we can gain so many insights from here.

# The Dataset

*The dataset that we will use is taken from `Kaggle` website and can be downloaded here:*

[`Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews`](https://www.kaggle.com/eswarchandt/amazon-music-reviews?select=Musical_instruments_reviews.csv)

*There are two formats available of the dataset: `JSON` and `CSV`. We will use the `CSV` one in this project.*

*Overall, the dataset talks about the feedback received after the customers purchased musical instruments from `Amazon`.*

"""*Overall, to each of our sentiment categories, we got F1 Score of 95%, which is great and because of that we can conclude that our model works well on the dataset.*

# Conclusion

**Dataset**

1.   Our dataset contains many features about user reviews on musical instruments. But, we rarely need those features as our model variables because those features are not really important for sentiment analysis.
2.   We might need to omit our part of removing stopwords in our preprocessing phase, because there might be some important words in determining user sentiments in our model.
3.   From our text analysis, we know that most of the transactions made are related to guitars or other string-based instruments. We can say that guitar got a really high attention from the customers' pool and the sellers can emphasize their products on this instruments.

**Model**

1.   We tried almost all classification models available. By using 10-Fold Cross Validation, we get that Logistic Regression Model got the best accuracy and we decided to use this model and tune it.
2.   On our attempt on making prediction to our test set, we also received a nice accuracy and high F1 Score. This means that our model works well on sentiment analysis.
3.   We need to consider more Cross Validation Method, such as Stratified K-Fold so that we do not really need to do resampling on our dataset. Also, we are fine without data scaling, but it is highly suggested to do it.
